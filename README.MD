## Summery
this application is to demonstrate my learned skills of front end development. It is the website for a band called the Monkees. It has a gig booking form as well as a music player is built using angularJS and basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with jQuery. The music player was built with JavaScript functions. The booking form and its validations are powered by javascript and anglerjs.

## Build
**For production build:**
```

```

## Testing
Jasmine is used for testing this app. It is the standalone version so tests are run in the file: **"SpecRunner.html"** at the root of the project and the spec file is located at **test/spec/appSpec.js**.

To run the tests edit the **appSpec.js** file and run the **specRunner.html**.
